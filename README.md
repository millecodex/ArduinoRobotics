# Welcome to Arduino Robotics @FutureTechCamp!

## Course Introduction
Welcome to the exciting world of Arduino robotics! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of building and programming your own robots using the versatile Arduino microcontroller platform. Whether you're new to electronics and programming or have some prior experience, this course will provide you with the hands-on skills and theoretical knowledge to bring your robotic creations to life.

Over the next few modules, we will explore everything from the basics of setting up your Arduino and writing your first lines of code to controlling motors, using sensors to perceive the environment, and developing algorithms for autonomous behavior. We'll combine theory with practical exercises, culminating in the construction and programming of your own robotic car.

Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The Arduino platform, with its open-source hardware and software, provides an accessible and affordable entry point into this fascinating domain.

**A Little Bit of History:** The Arduino project was started in Ivrea, Italy, in 2005. The goal was to create a simple, low-cost tool for students without a background in electronics and programming to create interactive projects. The name "Arduino" comes from a bar in Ivrea, where some of the founders of the project used to meet. It's named after Arduin of Ivrea, who was King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.

We hope you find this course engaging and rewarding. Let's get started on our journey into robotics!
